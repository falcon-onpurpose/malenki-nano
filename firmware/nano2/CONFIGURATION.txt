Configuration mode
------------------

Configuration mode allows the operator to change various settings
by remote control, which avoids the need to connect programmers etc
to change settings.

These are:

* Invert (left, right, weapon)
* Mixing on/off

1 pulse = no effect - so that the operator does not accidentally
    trigger anything if the switch is switched too slowly.
2 pulses = invert left channel
3 pulses = invert right channel
4 pulses = invert weapon channel
5 pulses = reset default - reset everything to default
6 pulses = mixing on/ off (on by default) - this will change the steering/throttle channels to left/right
    - if you want to use mixing on the tx.

There is also a "reset"

How do we enter configuration mode?
-----------------------------------

If the device gets no signal for a few seconds, it will automatically
enter configuration mode. 

In configuration mode, flipping the invert switch a number of times
will change the configuration.

In configuration mode, stick positions are mostly ignored and the motors 
do not drive. No pulses are emitted from the PWM outputs.

We do NOT enter configuration mode if we get a signal immediately after
power-on. If the transmitter is turned on before the receiver, 
the rx starts up immediately. This means that if (e.g.) in the middle
of a battle power is briefly lost, then it will restart immediately. 

How do we leave configuration mode?
-----------------------------------
To leave configuration mode:

1. Move the weapon stick to the centre
2. Move the throttle stick to the centre (it probably self-centres anyway)
3. Move the throttle away from the centre.

Some transmitters (e.g. the Turnigy Evolution) insist on the weapon stick
(CH2) is moved to the lowest position at startup. This is because that
channel is used for the throttle on quadcopters, they don't want the
drone taking off immediately at tx power on.

Quadcopter throttle is 1000us minimum 2000us maximum, because it
does not need reverse!
