HOW TO OPTIMISE FOR Attiny817

The 817 has 8kb of flash and only one TCB.

Everything else is the same.

* Remove all debug prints - with a #define maybe
* Remove unused code in spi handling assembly (does not get optimised out at link)
* Remove unused motor test mode
* Enable link-time-optimisation

---
Rework main.c to avoid use of the TCB1 peripheral
Can we use the TCD0 interrupts to increment the counter tickcount?
	- It overflows every 20ms instead of every 10ms.
	- We can just add 2 to the tickcount.
	- Configured in weapons.c


HARDWARE: There is only one ADC on the tiny817.

So we need to connect a DIFFERENT pin to VSENSE - cannot use PC2 because it does
not lead to a ADC internally.

CAn use PB4
